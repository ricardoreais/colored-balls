## Code Example

The game main engine is the random generator, which allows multiple combinations of the same game by generating random wrong answers, random wrong answers positions and also a random image.

```Processing
void generator() // Generates a completly new set of answers
{
  currentCountry = countries[rLandscapes.get(clicker)]; // New country
  currentCountryPosition = rLandscapes.get(clicker); //New country position
  rCountries.clear(); //Erases random array of numbers
  rPositions.clear(); //Erases random array of positions
  randomCountries(); //List with random countries (i.e. country index)
  randomPositions(); //List with random positions (position A, position B, position C & position D)
  if(flagMode1)  
    generateFlags(); //Generate new flags
  else if(flagMode2)
    generateAnswers(); //Generate new answers
}
```
